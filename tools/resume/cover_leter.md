Dear Recruiter,

As a skilled production operations manager with more than 10 years of experience, I'm writing to express my interest in the position at your company. I know I would make a valuable addition to your company.
I started my career as a quality engineer and transferred to the operational department as a result of my superiors' positive opinions. After contributing to the production department in my company, I've been offered by companies to support them with challenging operations thanks to my colleagues and superiors.

These operations were about starting-up a new plant, production improving, analyzing and solving problems causing production losses and reducing operational costs.

These challenging works helped me a lot to improve my operational and technical skills. Working in different plants with different teams from different cultures gave me a great opportunity to develop my communication and team management skills.

In addition to my experience, I have a passion for furthering my skills and contributing to organizations.

Please review my attached application for additional details regarding my expertise and achievements. Do not hesitate to reach me out if you have any questions or need further clarification on my experience.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Gökhan Aktaş
